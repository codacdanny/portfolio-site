          I have only been coding for about 3 years now, that might not seem
          like a lot, but during this period I have learned a lot of things, I
          have grown and I have overcome some difficulties. Having a
          mentor/guide in this career is really important especially if you are
          a self-taught developer. I remember back in 2020 while I was taking
          Jonas Schedtmannâ€™s course on Advanced CSS. In the first Project
          (Natours project) I was stuck for 3 months trying to write a css code
          for linear gradient. I already gave up on coding until my mentor
          helped me to figure out the bug in 12 seconds. It was just a missing
          comma, and that was what kept me for 3 good months. Coming into the
          tech niche as a beginner can be very overwhelming, the bugs, imposter
          syndrome, anxiety and the realization of a whole lot of things that
          you have to learn to be a good developer. Usually you might not have
          access to well accomplished devs with more than 7yrs of experience,
          you can learn a lot from an intermediate level dev just as you can
          learn from a senior dev.That is why I offer to help as many people who
          are trying to find their passion in the tech niche. I have mentored a
          handful of people and the experience has been great. Feel free to
          reach out to me for help.
